    "It can get annoying having to run `ruff` everytime before we share our code with our colleagues, for example by pushing it to our `git` repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's where `pre-commit` comes in. With `pre-commit` we can configure various checks on our code before our code is committed to our repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can add pre-commit as a dev dependency and generate a default configuration file.\n",
    "\n",

    "```bash\n",

    "\n",
    "This will ensure that the pre-commit hooks are run before the code is _actually_ commited.\n",

    "#### <mark> Exercise:</mark> Testing pre-commit\n",

    "With the sample configuration, you automatically checked for trailing whitespace, end of file fixer (newline at the end of the file, check if any yamls that exist in the repo are parseable and whether any large files were added. The pre-commit failed on the `end-of-file fixer`, but immediately corrected it. The pre-commit also failed on the `check-added-large-file check`, as the `test.cs` and`train.csv` exceeded the allowed limit. Want these files to be checked in anyway? Adjust your configuration by removing these checks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at [the documentation](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html) to see what other checks you can add! For example, `check-toml` to check whether the toml file is parseable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Some notes on pre-commit\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-commit is a very widely used tool to run multiple checks within repositories that contain Python packages. It makes it quite convenient to configure what checks to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as a developer, having pre-commit running in your local machine can become annoying since you won't be able to commit changes that contain code that doesn't pass the tests. Sometimes you might want to commit WIP changes that don't pass all tests (e.g. you don't have time to fix your code and wan't to save your WIP).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can configure and use `pre-commit` without running automatically on every commit by ommiting the `(uv run) pre-commit install` command during setup, or by explicitly unistalling it via `(uv run) pre-commit uninstall`. To run pre-commit manually you can execute `(uv run) pre-commit run --all-files`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, some `pre-commit` hooks run their actions on different environments than your package's virtual environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### <mark> Exercise:</mark> Adding `ruff` to pre-commit\n",
    "\n",
    "Add `ruff` to `pre-commit` and check that `ruff check` and `ruff format` run when you run `pre-commit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have a look at: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit\n",
    "- And also investigate how to add a *local* `pre-commit` hook that runs the version of `ruff` installed in your package.\n",
    "    - *Hint: set the `repo` value to `local` and use the values `id`, `name`, `entry`, `language`, `pass_filenames` and `always_run`.*\n"
