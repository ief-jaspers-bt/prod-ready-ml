    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by:\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: The identification of classes of objects \n",
    "    - which share common characteristics (*attributes*)\n",
    "    - and can do similar things (*methods*)\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: The idea that attributes and methods can be taken from other classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports all the basic features of an OOP language with this paradigm having some benefits:\n",
    "1. Code can be modularized\n",
    "2. Increasing understandablity and scalability,\n",
    "2. which makes collaboration easier,  \n",
    "3. and leads to better software maintainability. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='invest'></a>\n",
    "### The learning investment\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning this programming paradigm provides two benefits:\n",
    "- Understanding the Python data model to improve your understanding of Python and work more effectively with code\n",
    "- Being able to extend the Python language following consistent programming principles\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: This is not a recommendation to only use OOP going forward, but a deep dive into the Python programming language to better understand its implementation. Whether you choose to use this (or not) as a way of working going forward is up to you.\n",
